- 🧐 Fun Facts about me:
    - 🥇🥋 I practiced Kung-Fu for 8 years at various academies, training in the Choy-Lay-Fut style. I have numerous medals, the most important being a Brazilian champion medal in my style: junior freestyle. I had much more to learn and wasn't a black belt yet, but I had to stop due to financial reasons.
    - 🎮👨‍💻 I've always dreamed of a career in some computational field, whether in gaming, CYBER-SECURITY, or DEV as I am now, but I always lacked the first step (many say it's the hardest). However, in Jan/24, I was accepted into the technical school at the University of Campinas, and I've maintained an intense routine since then.
    - 📚😎 After being accepted into the technical school, I manage an intense study routine from 7:30 AM to 11:00 PM. It's extremely exhausting, but I believe in "NO PAIN, NO GAIN," because many successful elite individuals didn't achieve success without sacrificing important things, and time is the most valuable asset in life.
